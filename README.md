# Are you listening?

This organisation has been used to provide smoother collaboration tools for our Computer Science group projects at the [Unversity of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/studeren/aanbod/alle-opleidingen/informatica-studeren/). The organisation's name stems from a satirical question towards the listening audience during the project defenses.  

# Projects

The organisation contains a repository for each groupdproject of the Bachelor Program.
