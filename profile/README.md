# Are you listening?

This organisation has been used to provide smoother collaboration tools for our Computer Science group projects at the [Unversity of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/studeren/aanbod/alle-opleidingen/informatica-studeren/). The organisation's name stems from a satirical question towards the listening audience during the project defenses.  

# Projects

The organisation contains a repository for each coding project for a theoretical course of the bachelor program. 

## Datastructures-and-Abstraction

[[Fall, 2023 | Gegevensabstractie en -structuren, 1001WETGES]](https://github.com/Are-you-listening/Datastructures-and-Abstraction)
A first years assigment to implement a ticket system for a fictional theatre using a set of self-implemented datastructures.

## Languages-and-Automata
[[Spring, 2023 | Talen en automaten, 1001WETTAL]](https://github.com/Are-you-listening/Languages-and-Automata)
Group project on implementing automata from Language & Automata theory to show we master the subject of the course.

## Machines-and-Computation 
[[Fall, 2024 | Machines en berekenbaarheid, 1001WETMAB]](https://github.com/Are-you-listening/Machines-and-Computation)
The follow up course for "Talen en automaten", we implemented theoretical concepts like grammars, automata & turing machines.

## Compilers
[[Spring, 2024 | Compilers,  1001WETCOP]](https://github.com/Are-you-listening/Compilers)
The programming assignment for the theoretical compiler course was implementing a compiler ourselves! (Sounds like "YACC"â€¦)
